### Brandon's dotfiles ###

This is the Git repository for Brandon's dotfiles, which include his configuration files for bash, vim, git, irb, and tmux.

Use the installation script to initialize all of the vim plugins (many of them are installed as git submodules) and to symbolically link files to your home directory. The installation script currently only links bash and vim files to your home directory. Link the .gitconfig, .cvsignore, .tmux.conf, and .irbrc files if you want them!

    $ ./install.sh
